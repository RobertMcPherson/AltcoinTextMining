# AltcoinTextMining
Perform text mining operations on altcoin and ICO white papers 

The actual production code is in the "src" directory.  Instructions on how to run that code are in the README are also within the "src" directory.  Essentially, you can simply download all the files within "src" to your local directory where your PDF documents are stored, that you want to analyze.  All the processes are applied automatically to the PDF files, including data transformation and modeling, upon executing the python master script file, called "AltCoinTestMining.py".
