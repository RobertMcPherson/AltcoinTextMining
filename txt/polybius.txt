POLYBIUS TOKEN WHITEPAPER
Dra� May 10 2017

eToken
1. eToken Contract as a basis for Polybius Token (PLBT)
PLBT is a token issued within an eToken1 contract. There will be 20 000 000 Polybius tokens created for the ICO. No further PLBT will be generated a�er this phase of the project and all the unsold tokens will be destroyed.
eToken is an Ethereum smart contract, wri�en using Solidity2 programming language by Ambisafe3. It enables issuance of tokens in Ethereum network and provides a rich set of features:
1. Implementa�on of ICAP4 for mul�-layer transac�on rou�ng 2. Account recovery for the lost key scenario 3. Allowances 4. Automa�c ethereum network fee refunds 5. Integrated exchange with Ether currency 6. Ability to set transac�on fees
eToken also implements EIP205, also known as Standardized Contract API. EIP20 compa�bility ensures that integra�on with exchanges and other services will be no harder than for any other Ethereum-based token.

System
System Architecture Overview Concerns Breakdown Polybius project consists of 3 layers of so�ware responsible for diﬀerent concerns, as shown below:

Ethereum Network eToken Contract

1. Network infrastructure 2. Data persistence layer 3. Consensus/enforcement of the contract logic 4. Transac�on execu�on
1. Token issuance algorithm 2. Account balances database 3. Transac�on rules

Wallet So�ware

1. User interfaces 2. Business logic of token users 3. Transac�on crea�on

Network-level Interac�on Diagram
Ethereum network provides a medium for interac�on between companies and users. Par�es interact by sending transac�ons to the Polybius contract. All transac�ons are validated by contract business logic and recorded in the blockchain. Contract API is open to all internet users and anyone can become a user of Polybius token.

System

System Architecture Overview System-level Interac�on Diagram The eToken protocol supports 2 primary account security models: user-side keys and hosted wallet. User-side Keys In this case, private key that unlocks account is known only to end-user.

Hosted Wallet
In this case, ﬁnancial ins�tu�on (exchange or wallet provider) is responsible for key security. Only 1-2 keys per ins�tu�on are used and transac�ons are routed to speciﬁc user accounts using ICAP6 protocol.

Dividends Distribution
The dividends distribu�on process consists of two stages: ge�ng the accurate data about the PLBT distribu�on among users (dividends report) and spreading the company proﬁt among the tokenholders.
Dividends report
To have a proof of PLBT ownership by exact addresses, Polybius will make Snapshots of Blockchain prior each dividends distribu�on using a specially developed tool named Dividends Report. It allows to capture the current state of tokens distribu�on among investors as on the exact block. The number of the milestone block as well as an approximate date and �me of its appearance will be announced in advance both, by email and at the Polybius Website.
Distribu�on of the proﬁt
Polybius Founda�on ﬁnancial management undertakes to transfer 20% of the company distributable proﬁt to the Dividends distribu�on smart contract on a yearly basis. The date of dividends distribu�on will be announced in advance at Polybius Bank Website. Also users will be no�ﬁed via email twice.
In order to receive their share of dividends, users will be required to return PLBT tokens to the Polybius Wallet or any other wallet which supports the dividends payment mode in case, if they have been stored outside of it. The list of such wallets will be announced at the Polybius Website.
Polybius is nego�a�ng with all major exchanges regarding implementa�on of the dividends accep�ng func�onality. Polybius will inform customers whenever this feature will be available at any of them.
A Dividends distribu�on smart contract is designed to distribute proﬁt among the investors according to their stakes. All the payments will be made in ETH. Dividends will be sent to those addresses whose PLBT token ownership will be proved by Snapshot of Blockchain.
