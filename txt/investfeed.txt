2. THE PROBLEM

1

No central hub to buy/sell/exchange, access market data and news, or to chat about existing and emerging cryptocurrencies

2

No dedicated network for enthusiasts and professionals globally in the blockchain industry

Cryptocurrencies, especially newer alt coins, suffer

3

from lack of exposure, and in turn generate little

value for those who are not actively using a network

4

Content creators recognize how advertising may diminish their works value to the consumer

5

Crypto and alt coins information is too fragmented and scattered. Centralization is needed

6

Revenue opportunties for active community contributors are weak

3

3. THE SOLUTION
We have built a smarter social networking and market access platform (Browser and Mobile) for the cryptocurrency community. This will enable the community to establish professional relationships, learn, manage their wallets, and exchange ideas.
A smarter social networking and market access platform for the
cryptocurrency community.
The investFeed platform will:
▪ Ensure every cryptocurrency has its own dedicated feed, market data, and blockchain history.
▪ Allow users to earn & exchange digital currency, cryptocurrency, and money. ▪ Provide multi-language support to accommodate global consumption. ▪ Encourage users to share and boost content for viral search to bring value to many
passive users. Creators posting to investFeed may monetize merely by having their work recognized (or “liked”) by the investFeed community. ▪ Create clarity for the rapidly growing dynamic crypto and alt coin space. ▪ Accurately and transparently reward an unbounded number of individuals who make subjective contributions to the community. ▪ Allow users to establish career profiles on the social network ▪ Empower users to skip credit cards altogether and process FEED Token payments from smartphone to smartphone.
4

4. INVESTFEED GOALS
investFeed plans to disrupt the cryptocurrency industry by bringing transparency and ease of use which are currently lacking. Our main goal is to integrate cryptocurrencies into the traditional financial world and to create a single gateway to the market that is open, transparent, and rewards-based for all our users, contributors, and financial institutions wherever they may be in the world.
We have been in operation since 2014 and have a fully built-out social investing platform with multiple social networking features. This is not a planned product. It exists today. Our investFeed Social network app for Android and iOS is available in the respective app stores. We have experience and a proven track record maintaining a platform that caters to the needs of our users.
Our existing platform has over 15 thousand member sign-ups with over 200 thousand live feeds since launch. 78% of our users are experienced traders, 54% are affluent US adults ($100k+) and 52% are self-employed or founders. This user base can be seamlessly converted to our crypto-offering. Again, these are not forecasted user numbers. They exist today. Additionally, most crypto-traders invest in traditional financial assets as well as cryptocurrencies and so there is a natural synergy between our existing and new offering.
We are building a new financial ecosystem, a new way and we want our community to be our token holders. As much as we believe in the democratization of digital transacting, we also believe in putting the power of our community back into the hands of the community. As such, we are going for an ICO Initial Coin Offering and ask you, the cryptocommunity to be our supporters.
5

4.1. Goals
1. Provide cryptocurrency market data and news as well as fundamental, history, streaming data, charting and technical analysis tools.
2. Create cryptocurrency streams for sharing ideas between traders, entrepreneurs, and crypto enthusiasts.
3. Provide direct market access to Buy/Sell/Exchange over 721 cryptocurrencies from 3,846 markets, presently.
4. Allow for an integrated multicurrency wallet offering.
5. Enable the monetization of users’ feeds by allowing the crowd to subscribe to premium content

related to cryptocurrency - and allow users to syndicate their content to Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. 6. Create Boost; a unique feature that will allow a content creator to expand their reach by boosting to new networks. Creators can earn points which they can exchange for views. Or users can buy points to level-up your network. 7. Gamify the platform with FEED Tokens to incentivize contentcreators for their high-quality content. 8. Support English, Chinese, Russian, and many other languages.

5. INVESTFEED FEATURES

This will be delivered to you via the cryptocurrency epicenter which will feature a range of add-on services to improve your experience. All investFeed services are built on the Ethereum MainNet - to meet the highest level of security and transparency.

6. INVESTFEED TOKEN

Ethereum enables the creation of ERC20 tokens, which can be used in an incentive system to replace intermediaries. In investFeed’s system, FEED Tokens will play a key role in providing economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in common good. Unlike in Twitter where volunteers must donate their time to contribute and validate information, on investFeed’s platform, contributors will be rewarded for their work and incentivized to continue increasing the value of the community ecosystem.
6.1. The Role of FEED Token

Incentives
•Give and receive incentives for great
content

Purchases
•Purchase premium content from other members - articles,
videos & other
•Purchase an ad-free experience across the
platform

Boost
•Promote aka "Boost" your content by posting
a sponsored link or video to attract paying
customers

12

6.2. FEED Marketplace Capabilities
Every feature in the investFeed platform that gives any added value to its user will require payment using FEED Tokens. Every user who facilitates the use of a feature which in turn gives added value, will be entitled to receive FEED Token.
As the network grows, there will be limited token supply versus demand and the value of the FEED Token will naturally appreciate, establishing a healthy ecosystem and control mechanism that rewards beneficial content and suppresses the noise.
The below are a list of planned initial use cases for the FEED Token. However, this list is not exhaustive and as we have done in the past, we will listen and respond to our contributors and community network, incorporating their views on how to improve and add more value to the platform and the community.
▪ Members (media outlets, professionals and non-professionals equally) can contribute premium content and charge in FEED Token for access
▪ Promote your own content and profile for network exposure using FEED Token ▪ Experienced investors and analysts can monetize their knowledge and expertise
by sharing their ideas, articles, videos, and even portfolio performance and trade activity with their subscribers. The FEED Token fee be will determined by the content provider and may be set on a time-based subscription level or unlocking an individual piece of content ▪ Users can follow top traders and analysts and news outlets and receive real time alerts from those members via in platform notifications, email, SMS, and mobile push notifications using FEED Tokens ▪ FEED Tokens will be required to access the higher levels of advanced trader tools ▪ FEED Tokens can be used to purchase an ad-free experience from the network
13

6.3. Token Technology
Our tokens will be of a standardized ERC20 form, so they can easily be integrated or displayable for any other party who wishes to do so. All of this code will be publicly available in our repositories and can be audited by anyone who wishes to do so.
6.4. FEED Token Transaction Mechanics
Thanks to the Ethereum Blockchain all FEED Token payment transfers are performed in a decentralized, autonomous and completely transparent manner. Sites like https://etherscan.io allow you to see and follow transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.
We will strive to keep the architectural design and documentation as up to date as possible, so everyone can quickly grasp the underlying investFeed architecture. Currently we are developing a plan to improve and expand our specific technology stack and the full details about the backend solution will be elaborated upon in due course.
The initial marketplace mechanics will be centralized as we require a database where we can link contracts to premium content and investFeed products like ad-disabling. Our end goal however, is to fully decentralize the investFeed organization and underlying database by Q1 2019.
A connection with the Ethereum MainNet will be handled using Parity, which will serve as our Ethereum node. This will ensure that our connection to the network is always synchronized, and transactions can be processed and validated quickly and securely. A React and Web3 stack will be used as our front-end bridge and interface to monitor all events in real-time and record them in the database.

The number of tokens issued per Ether will depend on the Ethers raised as per below table. You can buy FEED Tokens using any amount of Ethers including a fraction of Ethers like 0.0023 ETH. We will be offering a discount to early contributors which will decay with number of Ethers purchased during the token sale. So, the earlier you purchase, the better the token price you will receive.

The funds become available to investFeed under the milestones described under 'Project Funds Release'. To promote trust in the investFeed project and to execute a successful Token sale we have established an escrow arrangement using a Multisig wallet for both Bitcoin & Ether.

Ether Multisig Wallet: We will be using standard Ethereum Multisig wallet contract created through the Ethereum/Mist Wallet.

Each withdraw from the fund will require 3 out of 4 below signatories to sign the

withdrawal transaction. Escrow signatories for both the currencies will be:

Toshendra Sharma & Gary Dmitriev will each receive 0.5% of the amount raised at ICO in ETH but with the minimum of 20 Ethers each. This will be treated in the P&L as part of 'cost of raising capital' and the escrow fees shall be paid out the day after the ICO has officially closed. They shall be calculated as follows:
▪ Total raised during ICO x 1% = total escrow fees (of which 1/2 are paid to Toshendra & 1/2 to Gary the day following ICO closing).
The remaining balance will constitute the funds the Escrow Signatories will release to the project as outlined below.
26

10.1. Project Funds Release
The ICO Balance after escrow fees will be released via Multisig on a 3 of 4 arrangement. Funds will be released in 3 stages when the following milestones are met:
1. FEED Token post-Token Sale complete: 50% funds released 2. Milestone 1: Application Infrastructure integration complete: 25% funds released
a. investFeed social network application operable, and connected to underlying market with live price tracking
3. Milestone 2: investFeed application live in beta: 25% funds released a. investFeed product live in beta, to a designated client’s requirements
Should the circumstance arise where the first milestone has not been met after a period of 90 days following completion of the ICO, the REMAINING funds raised will be returned to the purchasers.
10.2. Project Funds Usage
The proceeds of the funds raised will be used to deliver on our goal of disrupting the cryptocurrency industry and create a single gateway to the market that is open, transparent, and rewards-based for all our users and contributors. This will entail additional human resources within the team to deliver on our development roadmap. Most of the funds raised will be allocated to this development task.
We also intend to allocate 20-25% of the raise to marketing in order to drive community awareness and grow our community user base. This budget will go towards the creation of marketing resources, both in terms of content and ensuring we have the appropriate human resources to drive our brand via the appropriate channels.
Over and above development and marketing expenditure, investFeed will incur some administration, legal and other operating expenses which will form part of the usage budget.
27

11. OUR PROMISE
We want to grow a community of users that echoes our philosophy. If you believe in an open, transparent, rewards based alternative to the current status quo, then join us. You will find yourself among friends. We want to put you, the members of our community, back in the driving seat. In control of your privacy. In control of your investments. In control of your earning potential.
Our community is at the heart of investFeed.
Without you, we are nothing.
~ CEO, Ronald Chernesky

12. DISCLAIMER
NOT AN OFFER TO SOLICIT SECURITIES AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH FEED AND THE INVESTFEED APPLICATION
Last Updated June 21, 2017
This document is for informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer or solicitation to sell shares or securities in investFeed, Inc. or any related or associated company. Any such offer or solicitation would only be made by a confidential offering memorandum and in accordance with applicable securities and other laws. None of the information or analyses presented are intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Accordingly, this document does not constitute investment advice or counsel or solicitation for investment in any security. This document does not constitute or form part of, and should not be construed as, any offer for sale or subscription of, or any invitation to offer to buy or subscribe for, any securities, nor should it or any part of it form the basis of or be relied on in any connection with, any contract or commitment whatsoever. InvestFeed expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this document, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting therefrom.
The investFeed Token, or “FEED”, is a cryptographic token used by the investFeed application.
FEED is not a cryptocurrency.
At the time of this writing, (i) with the exception of being used to place ads on the investFeed platform, FEED cannot be exchanged for goods or services, (ii) FEED has no
29

known uses outside the investFeed application, and (iii) FEED cannot be traded on any known exchanges.
FEED is not an investment.
There is no guarantee – indeed there is no reason to believe – that the FEED you purchase will increase in value. It may – and probably will at some point – decrease in value. Those who do not actually use their FEED honestly and fairly may lose their right to use FEED and may lose their FEED to those that do use FEED honestly and fairly.
FEED is not evidence of ownership or right to control.
Controlling FEED does not grant its controller ownership or equity in investFeed, or the investFeed application. FEED does not grant any right to participate in the control, direction or decision making of investFeed or the investFeed application.
30

13. RISK DISCLOSURES
Risk of Losing Access to FEED Due to Loss of Credentials
The purchaser’s FEED may be associated with an investFeed account until they are distributed to the purchaser. The investFeed account can only be accessed with login credentials selected by the purchaser. The loss of these credentials will result in the loss of FEED. Best practices dictate that purchasers safely store credentials in one or more backup locations geographically separated from the working location.
Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
FEED and the investFeed application are based on the Ethereum protocol. As such, any malfunction, unintended function, unexpected functioning of or attack on the Ethereum protocol may cause the investFeed application or FEED to malfunction or function in an unexpected or unintended manner. Ether, the native unit of account of the Ethereum protocol may itself lose value in ways similar to FEED, and also other ways. More information about the Ethereum protocol is available at http://www.ethereum.org.
Risks Associated with Purchaser Credentials
Any third party that gains access to or learns of the purchaser’s login credentials or private keys may be able to dispose of the purchaser’s FEED. To minimize this risk, the purchaser should guard against unauthorized access to their electronic devices.
Risk of Unfavorable Regulatory Action in One or More Jurisdictions
Blockchain technologies have been the subject of scrutiny by various regulatory bodies around the world. The functioning of the investFeed application and FEED could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or actions, including the licensing of or restrictions on the use, sale, or possession of digital tokens like FEED, which could impede, limit or end the development of the investFeed application.
31

Risk of Alternative, Unofficial investFeed Application
Following the Crowdsale and the development of the initial version of the FEED platform, it is possible that alternative applications could be established, which use the same open source code and protocol underlying the investFeed application. The official investFeed application may compete with these alternative, unofficial FEED-based applications, which could potentially negatively impact the investFeed application and FEED, including its value.
Risk of Insufficient Interest in the investFeed Application or Distributed Applications
It is possible that the investFeed application will not be used by a large number of businesses, individuals, and other organizations and that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed applications. Such a lack of interest could negatively impact FEED and the investFeed application.
Risk that the investFeed Application, As Developed, Will Not Meet the Expectations of investFeed or the Purchaser
The investFeed application is presently under development and may undergo significant changes before release. Any expectations or assumptions regarding the form and functionality of the investFeed application or FEED (including participant behavior) held by investFeed or the purchaser may not be met upon release, for any number of reasons including mistaken assumptions or analysis, a change in the design and implementation plans and execution of the investFeed application.
Risk of Theft and Hacking
Hackers or other groups or organizations or countries may attempt to interfere with the investFeed application or the availability of FEED in any number of ways, including service attacks, Sybil attacks, spoofing, smurfing, malware attacks, or consensus based attacks.

Risk of Security Weaknesses in the FEED Application Core Infrastructure Software
The investFeed application consists of open source software that is based on other open source software. There is a risk that the investFeed team or other third parties may intentionally or unintentionally introduce weaknesses or bugs into the core infrastructural elements of the investFeed application interfering with the use of or causing the loss of FEED.
Risk of Weaknesses or Exploitable Breakthroughs in the Field of Cryptography
Advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computers, could present risks to cryptocurrencies and the investFeed platform, which could result in the theft or loss of FEED.
Risk of FEED Mining Attacks
As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens and cryptocurrencies, the blockchain used for the investFeed application is susceptible to mining attacks, including doublespend attacks, majority mining power attacks, “selfish-mining” attacks, and race condition attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to the investFeed application, FEED, and expected proper execution and sequencing of Ethereum contract computations. Despite the efforts of the investFeed team, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.
Risk of Lack of Adoption or Use of the investFeed Application
While FEED should not be viewed as an investment, it may have value over time. That value may be limited if the investFeed application lacks use and adoption. If this becomes the case, there may be few or no markets following the launch of the platform, potentially having an adverse impact on FEED.

Risk of an Illiquid Market for FEED
There very well may never be a secondary market for FEED. There are currently no exchanges upon which FEED would trade. If ever exchanges do develop, they will likely be relatively new and subject to poorly understood regulatory oversight. They may, therefore, be more exposed to fraud and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products and have a negative impact on FEED.
Risk of Uninsured Losses
Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, funds held using the investFeed application or Ethereum network are generally uninsured. In the event of any loss, there is no public insurer, such as the FDIC, or private insurer, to offer recourse to the purchaser.
Risk of Dissolution of the investFeed Project
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether, development issues with the investFeed application, the failure of business relationships, or competing intellectual property claims, the investFeed project may no longer be viable as a business or otherwise and may dissolve or fail to launch.
Risk of Malfunction in the investFeed Application
It is possible that the investFeed application malfunctions in an unfavorable way, including one that results in the loss of FEED.
Unanticipated Risks
Cryptographic Tokens are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks discussed in this White Paper, there are risks that the investFeed team cannot anticipate. Further risks may materialize as unanticipated combinations or variations of the discussed risks or the emergence of new risks.
